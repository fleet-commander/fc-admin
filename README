Fleet Commander

Fleet Commander is an application that allows you to manage the desktop
configuration of a large network of users and workstations/laptops.

It is primarily targetted to Linux systems based on the GNOME desktop.

Fleet Commander consists on two components:

- a web service integrated with Apache that serves the dynamic application and
  the profile data to the network.
- and a client side daemon that runs on every host of the network.

Fleet Commander relies on libvirt and KVM to generate the profile data
dinamically from a template VM running the same environment as the rest of the
network.

SETUP

These are the instructions to build and install the admin interface:

$ ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX # where $PREFIX can be /usr or /usr/local
$ make
$ make install

You must also create a fleet-commander-admin user and grant it privileges to
/var/lib/fleet-commander-admin and /var/lib/fleet-commander-admin/profiles

RUNNING IT

You must first enable the apache configuration, in Fedora systems you must do
the following as root (assuming you installed it in --prefix=/usr):

# ln -s /etc/xdg/fleet-commander-apache.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d

And the service must be available as a virtual host in apache, point your
browser to it and follow the instructions.
