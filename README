DISCLAIMER
This project is still in early development so a lot of things are not as well integrated as we want to. Some of these steps
are hacky and are just temporary.

SUMMARY
The web interface provides a user session running under a special user where the sysadmin can change settings
and then the sysadmin can select changes from the log that she/he wants included in the profile. Afterwards
he can deploy the profile in the system.

SETUP
You must create a system user called fc-user with display name "Fleet Commander"

This user will be used to create the "dumb" session that the sysadmin will see in the browser.

BUILD AND INSTALL THE GSETTINGS LOGGER
fc-gsettings-logger is the service that logs the gsettings changes and submits them to the central web service

to build it enter into the logger/ directory type "make" and "make install", note that you need the development
files for gio, libsoup and json-glib.

Note that to "make install" you need privileges to write into fc-user's home directory.

RUNNING
You need to run spice_session.py as root (as it needs to be able to run stuff as fc-user)
And you need to run server.py

Then go to http://localhost:8181 and you're ready to go
