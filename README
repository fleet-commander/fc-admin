Fleet Commander

Fleet Commander is an application that allows you to manage the desktop
configuration of a large network of users and workstations/laptops.

It is primarily targeted to Linux systems based on the GNOME desktop.

Fleet Commander consists on two components:

- a web service integrated with Apache that serves the dynamic application and
  the profile data to the network.
- and a client side daemon that runs on every host of the network.

Fleet Commander relies on libvirt and KVM to generate the profile data
dinamically from a template VM running the same environment as the rest of the
network.

SETUP

These are the instructions to build and install the admin interface:

$ ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX # where $PREFIX can be /usr or /usr/local
$ make
$ make install
$ mkdir -p /var/lib/fleet-commander-admin/profiles

These are the instructions to install the logger and enable a VM as a Fleet Commander template:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ cd logger
$ make install
$ cd ../data/
$ make install

The install prefix must be set to /usr so that the fleet-commander-logger.desktop
file makes it to the /etc/xdg/autostart directory.

NOTE ON THE LOGGER

The logger autostarts on a desktop session only when a special device shows up
in /dev/virtio-ports

RUNNING THE ADMIN INTERFACE

Fleet commander is a plugin for Cockpit. You should already have an installation
of cockpit in your machine. If not, install it first following the instructions
at http://cockpit-project.org/running.html

If you have used the /usr prefix, Fleet Commander plugin is already installed in
the cockpit plugin folder. Ig you choose something different like /usr/local
you can enable fleet commander executing the following command as root:

# ln -s /usr/local/share/fleet-commander-admin/cockpit/fleet-commander-admin /usr/share/cockpit/

Then, logout from cockpit if you are already logged in, and in the next login
Fleet Commander should be available under Tools.

Once in Fleet Commander, just follow the on-screen instructions.
